\begin{abstract}
\noindent
The contribution to VTK presented in this article is an extension to \code{vtkDiscreteMarchingCubes} to also create \code{vtkPointData} scalars containing the value of the neighbouring voxel. These can be used to remove regions of the maching-cubes\citep{Lorensen1987} mesh depending on the local neighbourhood.
The extension is based on the code of \code{vtkDiscreteMarchingCubes} of VTK-6.3.0 and is available on GitLab \url{https://gitlab.kitware.com/vtk/vtk/merge_requests/889} (and GitHub \url{https://github.com/Kitware/VTK/pull/18}).

\section{Introduction}

}
\label{fig:labelimage}
\end{figure}


This extension to \code{vtkDiscreteMarchingCubes} makes it possible to let \code{vtkDiscreteMarchingCubes} also create \code{vtkPointData} scalars containing the label value of the neighbouring voxel in a label image. This then allows to remove regions of the resulting mesh that are adjacent to specific labels. For example a label image as in Fig.~\ref{fig:labelimage} that was created by running a watershed on a distance map followed by masking with the original binary segmentation, a common procedure to separate regions in a binary image at constrictions (see e.g. \citet{Beare2006b}). Such a label image is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:labelimage}.

When creating meshes for each foreground label from such a label image the meshes are closed at the constrictions where the separation was introduced, see 3D view in Fig.~\ref{fig:labelimage} and Fig.~\ref{fig:dmcCO}.

With the contributed extension to \code{vtkDiscreteMarchingCubes} the resulting mesh contains additional scalar data for the points that holds the label value of the adjacent label. A simple threshold that extracts the regions of the meshes that are adjacent to the background label (0) then makes it possible to remove the capping at constrictions, see Fig.~\ref{fig:dmcCO}.

For example looking at label 19 and 21 (extracted by a simple threshold on the cell scalars generated by \code{vtkDiscreteMarchingCubes}) which are adjacent to each other but mostly separated by the background label, see Fig.~\ref{fig:dmcCOt21t19}.

An additional threshold on the point scalars then removes the capping at the separation, see Fig.~\ref{fig:dmcCOt21t19}.

An advantage of this kind of capping removal is that it is even possible after the mesh was modified by other filters, e.g. smoothed by \code{vtkWindowedSincPolyDataFilter}. However, in most cases the resulting meshes are not connected on the open border edges any more, i.e. there will be gaps between them. The \code{vtkCoplanarSurfaceExtractor}\citep{Grothausmann2014_r} can be used to avoid such gaps.
